#    This node receives the hints published on the topic /hint. Then it is 
#    able to elaborate them: it check if the person, location or weapon is 
#    already present in the ontology. In case it is not in the ontology yet
#    it adds it. After that it checks if the hint has already been saved in
#    the ontology, if it is the first time the hint has been received it 
#    checks if the hypothesy that correspond to that hint ID is complete 
#    and not inconsistent. In that case it checks if the hypothesy has 
#    already been sent, if not it publish the hipothesy on the topic /hypothesis
#    that is of type Hypothesis.msg.
